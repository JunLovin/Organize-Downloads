# How to use
For use you must **edit the file_path** of your downloads, in my pc is 'C:\\Users\mathi\Downloads', but your username is not there so you can write your username, just remplace 'mathi' with your username. If you have your downloads in another disk or folder, you just write the path.
### Like this **C:\\Users\yourUsername\Downloads**
### Or this **D:\\Downloads**
