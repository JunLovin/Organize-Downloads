Follow this steps to run my program:

-Change the username in notepad or code editor. In file_path='C:\\Users\yourUsername\Downloads'
-If you have your Downloads folder in another disk, you must write in file_path='D:\Downloads'
-You need download Python to run the program
-If the program doesn't run, you can use him writing in console 'python main.py' after you changed the file_path
-If you wanna run the program in console, you need write the path of the program. Example: 'C:\Users\yourUsername\Desktop\04-OrganizeFolders' then write 'python main.py'

If doesn't run i will fix it soon :)!
